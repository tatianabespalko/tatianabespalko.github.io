    <p>
      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      Passing cars, <br />
      When you can't see, <br />
      May get you, <br />
      A glimpse, <br />
      Of eternity. <br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

    <h2>June 2, 2005</h2>
    <p><img src="images/segway1.jpg" alt="The first day of the trip" /></p>
    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cellphone</li> 
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
